## Hello. ðŸ‘‹

I am Robin. I'm a full-stack software engineer, UI/UX designer and TypeScript/JavaScript magician.

I like to build things that help humans be more productive.

I'm currently building:
- [Kysely Codegen](https://github.com/RobinBlomberg/kysely-codegen) â€“ a popular database-to-TypeScript code generator.
- Sally â€“ an absence reporting system used by various companies.
- A Markdown-like language designed for advanced documents.
- A new ecosystem of novel, extremely fast and developer-friendly web libraries.

I am experienced building libraries related to:
- Low-level/byte-level JavaScript, performance optimizations
- Programming languages, parsers, serializers
- Web standards (HTML, CSS, ECMAScript, TypeScript, HTTP etc.)
- The Node.js runtime
- Databases (especially SQL)
- Web frameworks (e.g. React, Vue.js)
- Design, accessibility and WCAG
