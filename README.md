## Hello. 👋

Full-stack software engineer, designer and TS/JS magician.

I like to build things that help humans be more productive.

Currently building:
- [Kysely Codegen](https://github.com/RobinBlomberg/kysely-codegen) – a popular database-to-TypeScript code generator.
- Sally – an absence reporting system used by various companies.
- ████ – A Markdown-like language designed for managing advanced documents.
- ███ – A new ecosystem of novel, extremely fast and developer-friendly web libraries.

I create systems and tools related to:
- Low-level/byte-level JavaScript, performance optimizations
- Programming languages, parsers, serializers
- Web standards (HTML, CSS, ECMAScript, TypeScript, HTTP etc.)
- Web frameworks (e.g. React, Vue.js)
- Node.js
- Databases (especially SQL)
- Design, accessibility and WCAG
