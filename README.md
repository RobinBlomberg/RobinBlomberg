## Hello. üü£

Full-stack software engineer, designer and TS/JS magician.

I like to build things that help humans be more productive.

Currently building:
- [Kysely Codegen](https://github.com/RobinBlomberg/kysely-codegen) (‚≠êÔ∏è 597) ‚Äì a database-to-TypeScript code generator.
- Sally ‚Äì an absence reporting system used by various companies.
- ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà ‚Äì A Markdown-like language designed for managing advanced documents.
- ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà ‚Äì A new ecosystem of novel, extremely fast and developer-friendly web libraries.

I create systems and tools related to:
- Low-level/byte-level JavaScript, performance optimizations
- Programming languages, parsers, serializers
- Web standards (HTML, CSS, ECMAScript, TypeScript, HTTP etc.)
- Runtimes, databases and frameworks (e.g. Node.js, SQL, React, Vue.js)
- Design, accessibility and WCAG
